# Example Data Mining Project

This project demonstrates practical data mining and data analysis techniques, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic modelling workflows.

The goal of this project is to showcase how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using structured analytical steps.

## Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw datasets
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships
- Applied data mining techniques to extract insights
- Interpreted results to support data-driven decision making

This project reflects a typical end-to-end analytical workflow used in real-world data analysis roles.
